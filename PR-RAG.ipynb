      "3. **Atmosphere and Tension**: The Amityville Horror expertly crafts an atmosphere of dread and tension, building up to a terrifying climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n",
      "4. **Real-Life Inspiration**: Like The Conjuring, The Amityville Horror is based on a real-life event (the Lutz family's alleged haunting of 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island). This adds an air of authenticity to the film.\n",
